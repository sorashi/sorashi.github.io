Welcome to my new website!

I moved from [Hugo](https://gohugo.io/) to [Astro](https://astro.build/) as my [SSG](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Static_site_generator).
This should allow more flexibility when it comes to building more interactive experiences, for example, look at my Linear Diophantine Equation solver at the bottom of [this post](/linear-diophantine-equations), which uses [Preact](https://preactjs.com/) components.

It also allows me to fetch data while building the site, take a look at [this post](./useful-tools) featuring my recommended software tools.
On each build of this static site, the amount of stars on each of the featured repositories is updated.

Moreover, my site avatar is updated on each build of the site too.

I also created a [tag system](./tags) which should make searching through the article topics easier.

The site also respects your [prefered system theme](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/@media/prefers-color-scheme) (dark/light) using CSS.
Try switching your OS theme and see the site changing.

There are still some small bugs here and there and some features are missing, but I reckon the site is ready for production at this state.
